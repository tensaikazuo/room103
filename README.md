# Room 103 - Kazuo's Portfolio

This is my portfolio site. I built this site using [React Static](https://github.com/react-static/react-static).
My site's public URL is ~~here~~(closed 6/7/21). 

On Log page, I implemented simple update structure using Cockpit CMS and Jenkins.

Actually, I had limited time, only three days to launch the site, so the UI is maybe too simple,
but the inner structure of the site and its automation are novel to me. I hope this demo site helps you
a little if you are interested in React Static, Cockpit, or Jenkins.
